Integrating large amounts of intermittent and distributed energy resources into the power and heat grid is difficult. Data science has a great potential to balance out energy fluctuations and is a prerequisite for near-100% renewable energy systems. Join the community and fight climate change together with us by contributing high-impact open source code today!
